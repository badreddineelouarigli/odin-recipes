    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honey-glazed ham is perfect for holiday dinners or other special occasions. An easy, homemade glaze is brushed onto the ham during the last half hour of baking, adding incredible flavor and creating a sweet, sticky, caramelized coating your guests will love. I came up with the glaze for this ham using ingredients on hand and it's the best I've ever tasted.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps Needed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
