    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This holiday ham recipe is from my mom. She would cook this easy recipe on my birthday. Made with maraschino cherries, sliced pineapples, brown sugar, honey, and many more yummy ingredients. You'll love this ham dinner for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any special occasion — and it's not just for the holidays, it's great any time of year!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, halved</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can pineapple slices in juice, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps Needed</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Mix together maple syrup, orange juice, ginger ale, brown sugar, and honey in a medium bowl. Stir in juice from the maraschino cherries, and half of the cherries.

        </li>
        <li>Score the outer edge of the ham with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern. Cuts should be about 1/4 inch deep to allow the ham to soak up the juice.

        </li>
        <li>Place pineapples onto the top of the ham, and secure with toothpicks. Place cherries into the centers of the rings, and secure with toothpicks also. Tie the end of the bag closed with the ties provided, place in a large roasting pan, and cut a few small slits in the top of the oven bag.

        </li>
    </ol>
